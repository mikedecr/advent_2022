# Advent 2022 in Hy

Hy is a Lisp that compiles to Python.

The language barrier is noteworthy.

Python emphasizes readability, and it accomplishes that with special keywords, infix operators, comprehensions, and so on.
But it sacrifices _programmability_ because the syntax for invoking these constructs is not standardized across constructs.

Lisp is on the other end of the spectrum.
Lisp's simple prefix-style syntax makes makes it highly programmable and abstract.
It isn't _un_readable, but readability is left as an exercise for the user.

So...translating Python to Lisp can be a bit of an art.

The upside is that every exercise lays bare _some_ kind of lesson about language design and programming style.

I try to highlight these in comments as I go.
